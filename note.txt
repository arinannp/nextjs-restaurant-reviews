# In Git, feat, chore, and fix are commit types used in Conventional Commits 
to categorize changes made to the codebase. feat signifies a new feature, fix indicates a bug fix, 
and chore denotes changes to tooling, build processes, or other non-code related updates. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown: 
- feat:
Used when introducing a new functionality or feature to the application. 
For example, adding a new user interface element or a new data processing pipeline. 
Medium says "add dark mode toggle for user settings".
- fix:
Used when resolving a bug or defect in the code. For instance, fixing a component that 
renders incorrectly or an issue with data validation. 
Medium says "resolve issue with course filtering not updating".
- chore:
Used for changes that don't fit into feat or fix, and don't directly affect the application's functionality. 
This includes things like updating dependencies, build configurations, or minor changes to tooling or scripts. 
Medium says "update ESLint rules and dependencies".
